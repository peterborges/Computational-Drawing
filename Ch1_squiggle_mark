//>To consider some custom computational marks
//a squiggle is created in terms of radius, length, and the following actions

//currentLength starts at 0
//currentAngle starts at 0
//points starts as an empty list
//x starts at radius
//y starts at 0
//while currentLength is less than or equal to length:
//  new X is set to radius x cos(currentAngle) 
//  add the (newX, newY) to points list
//  currentLength is set to be the length of a line through points list
//  currentAngle is modified by a random value between -3 and 3
//create a smooth line through the points list

 // No for loop here. Instead, a global variable.
int y = 0;
